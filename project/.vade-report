# Vercel Speed Insights Integration Report

## Overview
Successfully integrated Vercel Speed Insights into the tantsaha-connect project, a Vite + React + TypeScript application.

## What Was Implemented

### Changes Made:

1. **Installed @vercel/speed-insights package** (v1.3.1)
   - Added to dependencies in package.json
   - Updated package-lock.json with all transitive dependencies

2. **Updated src/main.tsx**
   - Added import: `import { injectSpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights';`
   - Added initialization call: `injectSpeedInsights();` right after `registerSW({ immediate: true });`
   - This ensures Speed Insights tracking is initialized as early as possible in the application lifecycle

## Implementation Details

### Why This Approach?
This project uses:
- **Build Tool**: Vite (modern JavaScript bundler)
- **Framework**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript
- **Entry Point**: src/main.tsx

According to the Vercel Speed Insights guide, for frameworks not explicitly listed in the dashboard (like Vite), the "other" framework approach using `injectSpeedInsights()` is recommended. This function:
- Adds the tracking script to your app automatically
- Must be called once in the app (done in main.tsx, the entry point)
- Runs on the client side
- Integrates seamlessly with the application lifecycle

### What This Enables
Once deployed to Vercel and Speed Insights is enabled in the dashboard:
1. The tracking script will be added to the `/_vercel/speed-insights/*` routes
2. Performance metrics will be collected and sent to Vercel
3. Data will be viewable in the Vercel dashboard's Speed Insights tab
4. Users can monitor Core Web Vitals and other performance metrics

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree
- `src/main.tsx` - Added Speed Insights initialization

## Verification
- ✅ Build completes successfully with no errors
- ✅ src/main.tsx passes ESLint with no new errors
- ✅ Application structure preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps
1. Push these changes to the repository
2. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard for this project
3. Deploy the application to Vercel
4. Access the Speed Insights tab in the Vercel dashboard to view performance data

Note: Speed Insights data collection begins after deployment and will show data once users visit the site.
